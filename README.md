Hello World

Hello World! 

I am currently a student at Neuefische’s web developement programme. I have always been fascinated by programming and this year I decided to finally take the step to become a web developer and make my dreams come true.
I am looking forward to a future in a job that is challenging, requires perpetual learning and will help me further develop my skills as a developer. 💻
